# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
This repository serves as my submission for the Week 4 Assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera. The files inside the repository are as follows:

- `Week 4 Code Book.md`: A code book describing the data and transformations performed on the original dataset
- `run_analysis.R`: The R script that prepared, cleaned, and transformed the original data sets into the `CompleteDF`
- `CompleteDF.txt`: A text file and the final, tidy product of the `run_analysis.R` script.
